<h2>How does AMIS Exchange compare to other decentralized exchanges?</h2>

<p>
  When we looked around, we found that other decentralized exchanges tended to compromise.
  Often they use an off-chain matching engine (meaning they are still vulnerable to downtime and hacking),
  and often they offer a much poorer trading experience than a traditional exchange.
</p>

<p>We were determined to offer a full limit order book with automatic best execution running entirely on-chain -
   and thanks to our unique order book representation we succeeded,
   meeting our five goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>no off-chain matching engine so no servers to shut down or be hacked;</li>
  <li>a <a href="trading-rules">full limit order book</a>, giving clients the best possible price and the trading features you expect;</li>
  <li>clients don’t need to install any special P2P software;</li>
  <li>low fees (none for makers, 0.2% for takers);</li>
  <li>open platform - rather than just being an exchange we want to grow an ecosystem of smart contracts trading with each other.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who’s behind AMIS Dex Exchange ?</h2>
<p>In one sense, no-one is - the exchange runs entirely on the Ethereum blockchain, and the open source web UI is statically hosted on github (pending move to Swarm).</p>

<p>AMIS Exchange is being developed by <a href="https://github.com/amisolution">Amisolution</a>.

<p>
  It is a fork of the amazing work done by Kieran Elby, a technologist with a background in algorithmic trading systems.
  He previously spent over a decade building secure, high volume gambling sites for leading bookmakers. He first dabbled in
  bitcoin in 2013 before flipping to Ethereum in 2015.
</p>

<!--<p>We’re interested in growing our team in future - contact <a class="__cf_email__" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="a5cad5d5cad7d1d0cbccd1ccc0d6e5d0c7ccd1cace8bccca8b">[email&#160;protected]</a><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script></p>
-->

<h2 style="clear: both">Are there downsides to being 100% on-chain?</h2>
<p>Yes - transaction times are much slower than a centralised exchange. This is hard to avoid - 1000s of Ethereum nodes worldwide need to agree on the state of the orderbook (without trusting each other). You won’t find High Frequency Traders on AMIS Exchange - not necessarily a bad thing for everyone else! We’ve also had to reduce the number of price levels offered to allow us to perform best execution on-chain - so you’ll see prices like 1.23, not 1.2298502.</p>

<h2>OK, but how do I withdraw cash from AMIS Exchange?</h2>
<p>AMIS Exchange does not interface with the traditional banking system, so if you need cash in your bank account, you’ll need to use a third-party to turn your Ethereum or Ethereum tokens into cash.</p>

<p>Over time, we’re confident that withdrawing to a bank account will become less necessary for many clients as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>more coins and tokens are built on top of Ethereum, so transactions stay on-chain;</li>
  <li>more merchants accept payments in Ethereum or Ethereum-based tokens;</li>
  <li>more companies offer stable Ethereum tokens backed by fiat currency.</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, we're hoping ERC20 tokens backed by Bitcoin and USD (and other currencies) will become popular - AMIS Exchange will then be able to offer fiat pairs. Do we dare consider making a Balboa pegged digital asset or NZ Dollar backed token? ;)</p>

<h2>What are your fees? How does AMIS Exchange make money?</h2>
<p>Because we’re not dealing with banks, or user sign-ups, or hosting providers, we have much lower costs than traditional exchanges.</p>

<p>We guarantee to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>never charge any fees for depositing or withdrawing Ethereum, or Ethereum-based tokens;</li>
  <li>never charge any trading fees for orders that add liquidity to the exchange (that is, orders that rest on the book);</li>
  <li>never charge a trading fee of more than 0.2% for orders that take liquidity from the exchange (that is, orders that match against an order on the book)</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to avoid relying on trading fees, we hope to offer value-added products and services that build on top of our core exchange - see roadmap below.</p>
